# Deckforger v1

This is the repository for the first version of my first iOS app, [Deckforger](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/deckforger/id1197615697?mt=8). It's a simple Magic: The Gathering app which lets you keep track of the decks you own in real life. This version doesn't do much more than that, other than displaying some deck statistics and filtering out cards.

This was the first app I created. I had been learning iOS and Swift for a few months self-taught, and wanted something to show for when I started to apply for jobs. Magic is an interest of mine, and although there are several similar apps out there, I thought it'd be a good idea to make one myself and learn along the way. It was a success - I demoed the app during my first interview and got the job.

Deckforger has since been heavily refactored and polished as my iOS knowledge expanded. I've added several new features and slowly plan on adding more - you can view the latest version on the app store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/deckforger/id1197615697?mt=8).
